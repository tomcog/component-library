## Build: Vite lib mode, not tsup

The brief specifies tsup with a `.module.css: "copy"` loader. **That was tried and it fails silently** — do not go back to it. esbuild (tsup's core) has no CSS Modules support, so the build "succeeds" while producing:

- `var Button_default = {}` — the class map is empty, so every `styles.x` is `undefined` and no class is ever applied
- global, unscoped `.button` / `.primary` selectors in the CSS, which collide with the consuming app

The brief pre-authorized the fallback, so the build is Vite library mode with `vite-plugin-dts`. Scoped names are configured via `css.modules.generateScopedName` as `ui-[name]-[local]-[hash:base64:5]`, which keeps output readable when debugging in an app's devtools.

Vite is pinned to v5. `build.cssFileName` is a Vite 6+ option and is silently ignored on 5 — hence the CSS output is `style.css`, and `exports["./styles.css"]` points there. If Vite is upgraded to 6+, that filename can change; re-check the export path.

## CSS ships inside `@layer ui`

`wrapCssInLayer()` in `vite.config.ts` wraps `dist/style.css` in `@layer ui{...}`
at `generateBundle`. **Any unlayered CSS beats any layered CSS regardless of
source order**, so a consuming app can always override these components without
having to get its stylesheet import order right - which is not reliably
controllable in Next.js App Router anyway.

- It also means an app's own `--ui-*` overrides on `:root` (declared unlayered)
  beat the defaults in `tokens.css`, which is what makes per-app theming work.
- The plugin needs `enforce: "post"`. Vite emits the CSS asset from its own
  `generateBundle` (`vite:css-post`); without it this hook runs first and finds
  no CSS in the bundle - it fails silently, producing unwrapped output.
- `@import`/`@charset` cannot be nested in a layer. Neither is emitted today and
  the plugin errors if one appears, rather than shipping broken CSS.
- Verify with `head -c 40 dist/style.css` - a green build proves nothing here.

**Tailwind apps must declare the layer order, or the Button loses its
background.** Tailwind's preflight resets `button { background: transparent }`
inside `@layer base`. Layer order beats specificity, and a layer's position is
fixed the first time its name is seen - so if `@layer ui` is imported before
Tailwind, `ui` sits below `base` and the reset wins. Components render with
correct geometry and no colour, which reads like a broken build rather than a
cascade problem. The consuming app needs, before any other CSS:

```css
@layer theme, base, ui, components, utilities;
```

`ui` after `base` so preflight cannot clobber components; before `utilities` so
Tailwind classes passed via `className` still override them. The file carrying
that line must be imported **before** `@tomcoggia/ui/styles.css`. Non-Tailwind
apps need nothing: unlayered CSS beats layered, so their styles win anyway.
Verified in NextJob - `<Button className="bg-black">` renders black.

## Decided: one bundled stylesheet, not per-component CSS

`dist/style.css` is a single file containing every component's CSS. An app that imports only `Button` still ships all of it. **This is a deliberate decision — don't "optimize" it without the trigger below.**

- **JS already tree-shakes correctly.** Verified: with a two-component build, an app importing only `Button` drops the unused component's code entirely. This works because `dist/index.js` has named ESM exports and `package.json` declares `sideEffects: ["**/*.css"]`. Don't break that declaration.
- **CSS does not tree-shake**, because `import "@tomcoggia/ui/styles.css"` is one side-effectful import of a concatenated file. Projected cost at ~50 components is roughly 8-25KB gzipped — a projection from one component, not a measurement.
- **Rejected:** `output.preserveModules` + per-component subpath exports. It complicates the build, needs a generated exports map, and interacts badly with `rollupTypes: true` in vite-plugin-dts — for a saving no one will notice in these apps.
- **Safe to defer** because the migration is *additive*: per-component subpath exports can be added later alongside `.` and `./styles.css`, and no consuming app has to change. This is why deciding now was unnecessary.

**Revisit only if** a consumer appears where CSS payload is load-bearing — a marketing/landing page with a performance budget, not an app behind a login — and it imports only a component or two.

## Verifying a build

A green `npm run build` does not mean the CSS pipeline works. After any change to the build or styling setup, confirm in `dist/index.js` that the CSS module object has real hashed class names (not `{}`), and that `dist/style.css` selectors are scoped (not bare `.button`). The end-to-end check is `npm pack` into a scratch consumer and server-rendering a component to inspect the emitted `class` attribute.
